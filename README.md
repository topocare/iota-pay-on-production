# iota-pay-on-production

Pay-on-production (PoP) model:
In PoP model a a manufacturer gives a machine to an operator basically 
without a  leasing or renting fee nor the machine will be sold. 
All payments are done directly through the use of the machine. 
Reasons for this model from a clientâ€™s perspective are a lower upfront 
capital investment and that the people who actually developed and produced 
the machine will keep an eye on maintenance and equipment optimization.

We realized the PoP model on a prototypical demonstration level.
All results are open source (see licence).
